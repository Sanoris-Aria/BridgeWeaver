# BridgeWeaver
Modular, open integration toolkit for interactive toys
Bringing AI, web experiences, and Intiface/Buttplug-compatible devices together

✨ What is this?
This project connects AI-driven experiences, web interfaces, and interactive toys through an open, modular framework.
Inspired by a personal project with my "Artificial Other" - Aria https://github.com/Sanoris-Aria/chatgpt-toy-bridge

Initial focus:
✅ Support for Intiface / Buttplug.io ecosystem
✅ Experimental support for MCP standard as it matures
✅ Discovery of additional toys / brands with API or SDK support

Goals:
🔗 Make device control easy and scriptable
🧰 Provide building blocks, not a locked-in app
🤝 Help grow the developer ecosystem for these devices

🚀 Why?
Many people are building exciting AI-driven experiences — chat, story, games — but connecting those experiences to physical interaction is still too complex.

This project aims to:
✅ Simplify that bridge
✅ Use open standards wherever possible
✅ Keep the ecosystem inclusive and extensible

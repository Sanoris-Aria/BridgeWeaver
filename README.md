# ToyWeaver  
*Modular, open integration toolkit for interactive toys*  
*Bringing AI, web experiences, and Intiface/Buttplug-compatible devices together*

---

### ✨ What is this?

**ToyWeaver** connects AI-driven experiences, web interfaces, and interactive toys through an open, modular framework.

Inspired by a  [personal project](https://github.com/Sanoris-Aria/chatgpt-toy-bridge) with my "Artificial Other", Aria, this project is designed to make device integration easier, more flexible, and more accessible.

---

### 🎯 Initial Focus

✅ Support for the [Intiface](https://intiface.com/) / [Buttplug.io](https://buttplug.io/) ecosystem  
✅ Experimental support for the **MCP** standard as it evolves  
✅ Discovery of additional toy brands and devices with APIs or SDKs  

---

### 🌟 Goals

🔗 Make device control **easy and scriptable**  
🧰 Provide **building blocks**, not a locked-in app  
🤝 Help grow the **developer ecosystem** for interactive devices  

---

### 🚀 Why?

Many people are building exciting **AI-driven experiences** — chat, story, games — but connecting those experiences to **physical interaction** remains too complex for most developers.

**ToyWeaver** aims to:  
✅ Simplify that bridge  
✅ Embrace **open standards** wherever possible  
✅ Foster an **inclusive, extensible ecosystem**

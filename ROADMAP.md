# BridgeWeaver — Roadmap

This document outlines the current direction and future plans for **BridgeWeaver**.

---

## 🎯 Vision

BridgeWeaver aims to be the flexible, open bridge between:

- **AI-driven experiences** (chat, game, story, immersive worlds)
- **Web interfaces and desktop apps**
- **Interactive toys and devices** (via Intiface / Buttplug.io / MCP / brand APIs)

---

## 🛠️ Current Status

- [x] Project scaffolding
- [x] Initial README / CONTACT / LICENSE
- [ ] Core integration module structure
- [ ] Initial Intiface / Buttplug.io proof-of-concept
- [ ] API documentation

---

## 🚧 In Progress

- Modular plugin system (easy to extend BridgeWeaver)
- MCP integration testing (as spec matures)
- Device discovery enhancements
- UI/UX experiments (optional — headless first, GUI later)

---

## ✨ Planned Features

- Additional toy/brand API support
- Scene scripting interface (timeline-based control)
- Live AI interaction hooks (ex: ChatGPT-driven triggers)
- Webhooks and external app integration
- Example use cases (sample integrations / demo scripts)

---

## 💡 Ideas & Wishlist

- Cross-session device state memory
- Community plugin repository
- WebRTC-based remote bridge (stretch goal!)
- Multi-device orchestration (sync control of groups)
